I am a **postdoctoral researcher** in financial econometrics at [Örebro University](https://www.oru.se/) where my research focuses on developing and applying **Bayesian econometrics** methods to finance and macroeconomics. 

Prior to joining Örebro University, I completed my PhD at Insper under the supervision of [Hedibert Lopes](https://hedibert.org/).
