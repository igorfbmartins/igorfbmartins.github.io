I am a **postdoctoral researcher** in financial econometrics at [Örebro University](https://www.oru.se/) where my research focuses on developing and applying **Bayesian econometrics** methods to finance and macroeconomics. I'm also one of the organizers of the [Örebro Workshop on Macro and Financial Econometrics](https://www.oru.se/institutioner/handelshogskolan/forskning/konferenser/2025-orebro-workshop-on-macro--and-financial-econometrics/).

Prior to joining Örebro University, I completed my PhD at Insper under the supervision of [Hedibert Lopes](https://hedibert.org/).
